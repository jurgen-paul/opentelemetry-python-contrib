OpenTelemetry Flask Instrumentor
================================

This instrumentor creates OpenTelemetry spans for Flask applications. It just
needs to be installed in the virtual environment where OpenTelemetry and the
Flask application are. The instrumentation of the Flask application will be
done automatically.
